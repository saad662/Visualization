# Mandelbrot Research Project

Research Project WS22/23 at Hochschule Fulda, Germany

This project aims at optimizing the calculation of the mandelbrot set with tensorflow and enhancing the the image output quality by using the logarithm. It allows to set
different options and parameters and outputs the runtime-duration as well as the current image variance to the console.

### Setup

To run this project you need the following software:
- Python 3.9
- TensorFlow 2.11
- NumPy 1.23.4 (normally installed alongside TF)
- Matplotlib 3.6.2
- (Optional) A working CUDA environment for GPU support

The versions presented above are tested. Newer or older releases might work too.

After that just start app.py:
`python ./app.py`
